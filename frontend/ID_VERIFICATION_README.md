# ID Verification Feature

## Overview
The ID verification feature has been implemented as part of the user signup process to verify age and identity. This feature allows users to upload or capture photos of their ID documents for verification.

## Features

### Supported ID Types
- Driver's License
- Passport  
- Health Card

### Upload Methods
1. **File Upload**: Users can select an image file from their device
2. **Camera Capture**: Users can take a photo using their device's camera

### File Requirements
- **Accepted Formats**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP
- **Maximum Size**: 10MB
- **Image Quality**: Clear, readable images of ID documents

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
- **Main Component**: `src/lib/components/IdVerification.svelte`
- **Integration**: Integrated into signup flow at step 4
- **Event Handling**: Uses Svelte's event dispatcher for communication

### Key Features
- **Real-time Camera Access**: Uses `getUserMedia` API for camera functionality
- **File Validation**: Client-side validation for file type and size
- **Preview Functionality**: Shows uploaded/captured image before submission
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for various scenarios

### User Flow
1. User reaches step 4 in signup process
2. ID verification component is displayed
3. User chooses upload method (file or camera)
4. If using camera:
   - Camera permission is requested
   - Live camera feed is displayed with ID frame overlay
   - User positions ID within frame and captures photo
5. Image preview is shown with file details
6. User clicks "Verify ID" to submit
7. Verification process is simulated (2-second delay)
8. Success message is displayed
9. User proceeds to next step automatically

### Technical Implementation

#### Camera Functionality
```javascript
// Camera access
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ 
    video: { 
        facingMode: 'environment',
        width: { ideal: 1920 },
        height: { ideal: 1080 }
    } 
});

// Photo capture
canvasElement.toBlob((blob) => {
    const file = new File([blob], 'id-photo.jpg', { type: 'image/jpeg' });
    validateAndSetFile(file);
}, 'image/jpeg', 0.8);
```

#### File Validation
```javascript
// File type validation
if (!acceptedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
    error = "Please select a valid image file (JPEG, PNG, or WebP)";
    return;
}

// File size validation
if (file.size > maxFileSize) {
    error = "File size must be less than 10MB";
    return;
}
```

#### Event Communication
```javascript
// Component dispatches verification event
dispatch('verified', { file: selectedFile });

// Parent component handles event
function handleIdVerification(event: CustomEvent) {
    idVerified = true;
    idVerificationFile = event.detail.file;
    nextStep();
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side
- File type validation prevents malicious file uploads
- File size limits prevent large file attacks
- Camera access requires explicit user permission

### Backend Integration (Future)
- Server-side file validation
- Image processing and OCR for ID verification
- Secure file storage with encryption
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Styling

### Design System Integration
- Uses existing CSS variables for consistent styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible color contrast and focus states

### Key CSS Classes
- `.id-verification`: Main container
- `.upload-options`: File upload and camera options
- `.camera-container`: Camera interface
- `.preview-container`: Image preview
- `.error-message` / `.success-message`: Status messages

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 53+
- Firefox 36+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

### Required APIs
- `getUserMedia` for camera access
- `FileReader` for file handling
- `Canvas API` for image processing
- `Blob` and `URL.createObjectURL` for file preview

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **OCR Integration**: Automatic text extraction from ID images
2. **Face Recognition**: Verify photo matches user
3. **Document Type Detection**: Automatic ID type recognition
4. **Liveness Detection**: Prevent photo-of-photo attacks
5. **Multi-language Support**: International ID formats

### Backend Integration
1. **API Endpoints**: File upload and verification endpoints
2. **Database Storage**: Secure storage of verification data
3. **Verification Status**: Track verification progress
4. **Admin Interface**: Manual verification review system

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] File upload with valid image formats
- [ ] File upload with invalid formats (should show error)
- [ ] File upload with oversized files (should show error)
- [ ] Camera access and photo capture
- [ ] Camera permission denial handling
- [ ] Image preview functionality
- [ ] Remove/retake photo functionality
- [ ] Verification submission process
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for validation functions
- Integration tests for camera functionality
- E2E tests for complete user flow
- Performance tests for file handling

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- HTTPS required for camera access (production)
- Adequate file upload limits configured
- CDN configured for image storage (future)

### Monitoring
- File upload success/failure rates
- Camera access success rates
- Verification completion rates
- Error tracking and reporting

## Support
